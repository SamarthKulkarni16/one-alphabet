-- Two changes:
-- 1. Ending a battle early now requires both players to agree. A single
--    click sends a request; if the other player clicks too, that's their
--    agreement and the battle actually ends. Either player can cancel a
--    pending request (withdraw their own ask, or decline the other's).
-- 2. The AI judge now writes a separate, longer "reasoning" in addition to
--    the short public-facing summary.
