-- Spectator mode: anyone (signed in or not) can watch a battle while it's
-- live. Scoped strictly to status = 'live' — once a battle completes, the
-- public `matches` table (already publicly readable, see schema.sql) is
-- the record of truth, so we don't need to keep battles/turns open after
-- that. Participants keep their existing full-access policies from
-- 012_live_battles.sql; these are additive permissive policies for anon.
