-- Battles only ever flip live -> completed when a participant's own
-- browser is open at the moment their countdown hits zero (TextBattle /
-- AudioBattle call endBattle() client-side). If both tabs are closed
-- before/at that moment — or a battle is just an old test row nobody
-- ever finished — it stays status='live' forever, which means it never
-- stops showing up on /watch (frozen at 0:00 remaining, no turns).
--
-- This is a maintenance sweep that closes out anything past its
-- duration + grace period, called opportunistically from getLiveBattles()
-- on every /watch load (see lib/battle.ts) rather than needing a cron.
-- Deliberately not participant-scoped like complete_battle() — it has no
-- auth.uid() check, since it may run with nobody signed in.
