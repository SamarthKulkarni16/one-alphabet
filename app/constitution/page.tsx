    title: "Match Structure",
    body: `Standard matches run 10 minutes, free-flowing, with one judge and one referee. Players first attempt to agree on the topic and who speaks first. If they cannot agree who speaks first, the referee decides \u2014 final.`,

    title: "Rule Philosophy",
    body: `Phones, outside assistance, and physical contact are not allowed except in special leagues that explicitly permit them. Threats result in a permanent ban. Preventing your opponent from speaking is not illegal \u2014 it is poor strategy, and judges score accordingly.`,
